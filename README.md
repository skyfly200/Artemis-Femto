# Artemis-Femto
A smaller and simpler Artemis board not much larger than the bare Artemis module

Based on the Artemis Nano design files from Sparkfun Electronics

Stripped out all connectors, battery charge circuitry and the USB to serial programming interface

All thats left is the voltage regulator, supporting circutry for the Artemis and 4 Dot star LEDs
